  If story is set in the past:
  - world_setting.era = "1950s America"
  - characters: period-appropriate clothing
  - locations: period-accurate buildings, cars, decor

  ## MANDATORY RULES:
  1. ALL "name" fields MUST be in ENGLISH (e.g., "Mother", "Courthouse", NOT "Me", "Toa an")
  2. ALL prompts (portrait_prompt, location_prompt, character_lock, location_lock) MUST be in ENGLISH
  3. Analyze world_setting FIRST before creating characters/locations
  4. Characters + Locations MUST match world_setting (same era, same style, same tone)

  ## CONSISTENCY CHECK:
  Before returning, verify:

  You are an AI Director. Analyze CONTENT and create VISUAL MOMENTS that accurately represent the narration.

  ## CONTEXT - CHARACTERS AND LOCATIONS:
  {characters_info}

  {locations_info}

  ## INPUT - Scenes (max 8s/scene):
  ---
  {srt_with_timestamps}
  ---

  ## CRITICAL RULES:

  ### RULE 1: SCENE TYPES - Identify what type of content this is:
  - **PRESENT ACTION**: Character doing something NOW → Show the action directly
  - **FLASHBACK/MEMORY**: "When I was a kid...", "I remember..." → Show the MEMORY scene (use YOUNGER versions of characters!)
  - **NARRATION/REFLECTION**: Character reflecting on feelings → Show character in contemplative pose in CURRENT location
  - **YOUTUBE CTA**: "Like and subscribe", "Comment below" → SKIP or show narrator speaking to camera

  ### RULE 2: FLASHBACK AGE ADJUSTMENT
  If scene is a MEMORY/FLASHBACK:
  - Mother at age 55 NOW → Show her as 30-35 years old in flashback
  - "When I was 8" → Show child version, mother should be ~25-30 years younger
  - Use "young version of [character]" in visual_moment

  ### RULE 3: LOCATION MATCHING
  Match the visual to WHERE the action happens:
  - "I am sitting on courthouse steps" → loc_courthouse
  - "She worked at dry cleaning shop" → loc_dryclean (create if not exists)
  - "Convenience store" → loc_convenience (create if not exists)
  - "I built my house" → loc_construction (create if not exists)
  - If pure narration with no location hint → Use current scene location (usually narrator's current position)

  ### RULE 4: NARRATION WITHOUT ACTION
  If text is PURE NARRATION (no specific action described):
  - Show narrator in contemplative pose at CURRENT location
  - Example: "She was everything to me" → Close-up of narrator's face, thoughtful expression, current location
  - DO NOT invent random actions that aren't in the text!

  ### RULE 5: SKIP YOUTUBE CTA
  If text contains: "like button", "subscribe", "comment below", "where you are watching from"
  - Set visual_moment to: "Continue previous scene - narrator speaking"
  - This avoids creating nonsensical visuals for meta-content

        "visual_moment": "Continue previous scene - narrator on courthouse steps, looking at camera, speaking directly"
      }}
    ]
  }}

  ## EXAMPLES OF GOOD VISUAL MOMENTS:

  Content: "My mother worked two jobs. During the day she worked at a dry cleaning shop"
  → scene_type: "FLASHBACK"
  → visual_moment: "YOUNG mother (30 years old) operating large pressing machine at dry cleaning shop, face showing fatigue"
  → location_id: "loc_dryclean" (new location)

  Content: "She would come home smelling like detergent, her feet swollen"
  → scene_type: "FLASHBACK"
  → visual_moment: "YOUNG mother sitting on worn sofa, removing shoes to reveal swollen feet, exhausted expression"
  → location_id: "loc2" (apartment)

  Content: "I built my first house with my own hands"
  → scene_type: "FLASHBACK"
  → visual_moment: "Man swinging hammer at house under construction, wooden frame visible, look of determination"
  → location_id: "loc_construction" (new location)

  Content: "Hit that like button and subscribe"
  → scene_type: "YOUTUBE_CTA"
  → visual_moment: "Continue previous scene - narrator speaking directly"

  ## MANDATORY:
  1. scene_id MUST match input order (1, 2, 3...)
  2. visual_moment MUST reflect the ACTUAL content (not random actions!)
  3. For FLASHBACK scenes, use YOUNGER versions of characters
  4. Create new_locations if story mentions places not in the location list
  5. NEVER show random unrelated actions!
