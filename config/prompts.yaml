  ## EXAMPLE 2 - Modern Urban Story:
  If story is about city office life:
  - world_setting.setting = "Modern New York City"
  - characters: wearing suits, business casual
  - locations: glass office buildings, upscale apartments, coffee shops

  ## EXAMPLE 3 - Historical Story:
  If story is set in the past:
  - world_setting.era = "1950s America"
  - characters: period-appropriate clothing
  - locations: period-accurate buildings, cars, decor

  ## MANDATORY RULES:
  1. ALL "name" fields MUST be in ENGLISH (e.g., "Mother", "Courthouse", NOT "Me", "Toa an")
  2. ALL prompts MUST be in ENGLISH
  3. Analyze world_setting FIRST before creating characters/locations

  ## CRITICAL - CHARACTER AGE VERSIONS:
  4. For story narration with flashbacks, create MULTIPLE VERSIONS of main characters:
     - nvc = Narrator PRESENT age
     - nvc_young = Narrator YOUNG ADULT (18-28yo) for adult flashbacks
     - nvc1 = Narrator CHILD (is_child=true, filename=NONE)
     - nv1 = Mother PRESENT age
     - nv1_young = Mother YOUNG (when narrator was child, ~30-35yo)
  5. Each character version needs its own portrait_prompt and character_lock
  6. Add "timeline" field: "PRESENT", "CHILDHOOD_FLASHBACK", "ADULT_FLASHBACK"

  ## CRITICAL - EXTRACT ALL LOCATIONS:
  7. Extract EVERY location mentioned in story:
     - Courthouse, apartment, bedroom, dry cleaning shop, convenience store, construction site, finished house, etc.
  8. Each location needs "timeline" field to match when it appears in story
  9. Create at least 5-7 locations for visual variety in a typical story

  ## CHARACTER RULES:
  10. character_lock MUST have: Age + Gender + Face features + Hair + Skin + CLOTHING
  11. portrait_prompt: MUST have "Pure white studio background", "neutral expression", "looking directly at camera"
  12. Children (is_child=true): portrait_prompt = "DO_NOT_GENERATE", filename = "NONE"
  13. ID format: nvc, nvc_young (narrator), nv1, nv1_young, nv2 (others), nvc1 (child narrator)

  ## LOCATION RULES:
  14. location_prompt: MUST have "Empty, no people"
  15. Add lighting_default appropriate for the scene mood
  16. filename uses .png (NOT .jpg)

  ## OUTPUT:
  17. Return pure JSON only, NO markdown code blocks

  ## VISUAL VARIETY CHECK:
  Before returning, verify you have:
  - [ ] At least 2 versions of narrator (present + young/child)
  - [ ] At least 2 versions of mother if she appears in flashbacks (present + young)
  - [ ] At least 5-7 different locations covering all mentioned places
  - [ ] Timeline tags on all characters and locations
  - [ ] Enough variety to make a visually interesting video (not repetitive!)

# STEP 2: DIRECTOR'S TREATMENT (Visual Story Plan)
# =============================================================================
# Input: {story_text} - Full story content
# Output: Story structure, emotional arc, visual plan for each part
# THIS STEP IS CRITICAL - Creates the "film blueprint" before individual scenes
# =============================================================================

directors_treatment: |
  You are a Film Director. Read the FULL STORY and create a DIRECTOR'S TREATMENT.
  This is the master plan for how the video will look and feel.

  ## INPUT - FULL STORY:
  ---
  {story_text}
  ---

  ## YOUR TASK:
  Analyze the story like a film director would:
  1. Understand the NARRATIVE STRUCTURE (beginning, middle, end)
  2. Identify EMOTIONAL BEATS (what feelings to evoke at each point)
  3. Plan VISUAL STRATEGY for each part (not every word needs a visual!)
  4. Create a coherent VISUAL NARRATIVE that tells the story effectively

  ## STORY STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:

  ### IDENTIFY THE PARTS:
  Most personal stories have this structure:
  - **HOOK/OPENING**: Grab attention, set up conflict (usually present day)
  - **BACKSTORY**: How we got here (usually flashbacks)
  - **RISING ACTION**: Building toward the conflict
  - **CLIMAX**: The main conflict/confrontation
  - **RESOLUTION**: How it ended, lessons learned

  ### EMOTIONAL ARC:
  Map the emotional journey:
  - Opening: Tension, curiosity, hook
  - Backstory: Warmth, nostalgia, sympathy
  - Rising: Hope, determination, pride
  - Climax: Betrayal, shock, pain
  - Resolution: Justice, closure, reflection

  ## CRITICAL RULES:
  1. UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE STORY before planning visuals
  2. NOT every sentence needs a unique visual - some continue the previous scene
  3. Emotional arc should be CLEAR in the visual treatment
  4. Plan for VARIETY - different locations, different shot types, different moods
  5. The video should FEEL like a film, not a slideshow of unrelated images

  OUTPUT: JSON object with complete director's treatment, NO markdown.

directors_shooting_plan: |
  You are a FILM DIRECTOR creating a SHOOTING PLAN for a video.
  Think like a REAL FILM DIRECTOR - first understand the story, then plan the shots.

  ## YOUR WORKFLOW (2 STEPS):

  ### STEP 1: ANALYZE THE STORY (from TXT)
  Read the full story and identify:
  - How many PARTS/SECTIONS does this story have?
  - What is the KEY MESSAGE of each part?
  - What KEY IMAGES are needed to VISUALLY TELL each part?

  Example analysis:
  ```
  HOOK: Courthouse betrayal → KEY IMAGE: Man alone on courthouse steps
  PART 1: Poor childhood → KEY IMAGES: Old house, Mother-son at market
  PART 2: Working hard → KEY IMAGES: Building house, Sweating
  PART 3: Completion → KEY IMAGE: Finished house, Mother crying happy
  PART 4: Betrayal → KEY IMAGES: Eviction, Court summons
  ```

  ### STEP 2: PLAN THE SHOTS (using SRT timestamps)
  For each KEY IMAGE, determine:
  - Which SRT segment does it belong to?
  - How many SHOTS needed based on duration (duration ÷ 8s)?
  - What CAMERA ANGLES to use for variety?
  - Create detailed img_prompt for each shot

  ## RULES:
  - Maximum 8 seconds per image
  - Each story part: duration ÷ 8 = number of shots (round up)
  - Use DIFFERENT camera angles for variety (like a real film!)
  - Images must TELL THE STORY, not just illustrate words
  - KEY IMAGES first, then break into shots

  ## CAMERA ANGLE SEQUENCE (for variety):
  1. WIDE/ESTABLISHING - Set the scene, show location
  2. MEDIUM - Show character in context
  3. CLOSE-UP - Emotional detail, face
  4. EXTREME CLOSE-UP - Detail (hands, object, tears)
  5. OVER-SHOULDER / TWO-SHOT - Interaction between characters
  6. LOW/HIGH ANGLE - Dramatic emphasis

  IMPORTANT: Vary your angles! Don't use same angle twice in a row.

  ## EMOTION & ACTION RULES:
  - Match EMOTION to content (hard work = DETERMINED, not SMILING)
  - Use ACTION VERBS: BUILDING, SWEATING, CRYING (not HOLDING, STANDING)
  - Show the STRUGGLE, not just the pose

  ## CHILD CHARACTER RULES:
  - Children should NOT be in reference_files (API policy)
  - Describe children INLINE in img_prompt: "(Child: 8yo Vietnamese boy, thin, hopeful eyes)"

  ## INPUT:

  **STORY TEXT:**
  {story_text}

  **SRT SEGMENTS (with timestamps):**
  {srt_segments}

  **CHARACTERS:**
  {characters_info}

  **LOCATIONS:**

  ## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. CALCULATE images needed: duration_seconds ÷ 8, round UP
  2. VARY camera angles - don't repeat the same shot type consecutively!
  3. Match SRT timestamps to shots - each shot covers ~8 seconds of narration
  4. Use characters/locations from the provided lists
  5. Children (nvc1) should be DESCRIBED in img_prompt, NOT in reference_files
  6. Every img_prompt MUST end with the global_style
  7. Make it feel like a FILM with visual variety!

  ## SHOT TYPE GUIDE:
  - WIDE/ESTABLISHING: Set scene, show environment (24mm)
  - MEDIUM: Character in context, waist up (50mm)
  - CLOSE-UP: Face, emotion (85mm)
  - EXTREME CLOSE-UP: Details, hands, objects (100mm)
  - OVER-SHOULDER: Conversation, relationship
  - TWO-SHOT: Two characters together
  - LOW ANGLE: Power, heroic
  - HIGH ANGLE: Vulnerability, small

  ## !!! CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST !!!

  SHOW THE MEMORY, NOT THE PERSON REMEMBERING!

  WRONG: "When I was a kid..." → 30yo man at courthouse thinking
  RIGHT: "When I was a kid..." → 8yo CHILD + 32yo MOTHER in apartment!

  WRONG: "My mother worked two jobs" → 30yo man talking about mom
  RIGHT: "My mother worked two jobs" → 32yo MOTHER at dry cleaning shop!

  WRONG: "I built my house" → 30yo man at courthouse
  RIGHT: "I built my house" → 28yo MAN hammering at construction site!

  ## !!! CHILD POLICY - API SAFETY !!!

  CHILDREN (is_child=true) → NO REFERENCE IMAGE!
  - Do NOT include child IDs in reference_files (causes API policy violation)
  - Instead: DESCRIBE child FULLY in img_prompt using character_lock
  - Only use adult + location references

  Example for CHILDHOOD scene:
  ```
  characters_in_scene: ["nv1_young", "nvc1"]     // Both listed here
  reference_files: ["nv1_young.png", "loc_apartment.png"]  // NO nvc1.png!
  img_prompt: "...32yo mother HUGGING a young 8-year-old boy with messy brown hair, innocent blue eyes, freckles, wearing old faded t-shirt..."
  ```
  ↑ Child described INLINE, not referenced!

  ## DECISION TREE - For EACH SRT segment:

  Q1: Does it mention CHILDHOOD or MOTHER'S SACRIFICE?
      Keywords: "when I was a kid", "my mother", "she worked", "growing up"
      → scene_type: CHILDHOOD_FLASHBACK
      → characters: ["nv1_young"] or ["nv1_young", "nvc1"]
      → location: loc_dryclean, loc_apartment, loc_convenience
      → SHOW: 32yo mother + 8yo child, NOT 30yo narrator!

  Q2: Does it mention BUILDING HOUSE or CAREER (narrator alone)?
      Keywords: "I built", "carpenter", "saved money", "bought land"
      → scene_type: ADULT_FLASHBACK
      → characters: ["nvc_young"]
      → location: loc_construction, loc_land
      → SHOW: 28yo man working, NOT 30yo narrator talking!

  Q2b: ADULT FLASHBACK with MOTHER present?
      Keywords: "she walked in", "mom came", "she hugged", "she said", "proud of you"
      → scene_type: ADULT_FLASHBACK
      → characters: ["nvc_young", "nv1"]
      → location: loc_finished_house
      → SHOW: 28yo man + 55yo mother together!
      → NOTE: Use nv1 (55yo), NOT nv1_young (32yo) - mother is older now!

  Q3: Is it PRESENT MOMENT?
      Keywords: "right now", "sitting here", "today", "courthouse"
      → scene_type: FRAME_PRESENT
      → characters: ["nvc"]
      → location: loc_courthouse
      → SHOW: 30yo narrator at courthouse with ACTION

  Q4: Is it YOUTUBE CTA?
      Keywords: "subscribe", "like button", "comment"
      → scene_type: YOUTUBE_CTA
      → characters: ["nvc"]
      → location: KEEP CURRENT STORY LOCATION (don't use "plain background"!)
      → SHOW: Narrator at SAME LOCATION, same SERIOUS expression
      → EMOTION: Match story context! If story is heavy → SERIOUS face, NOT smiling!
      → NOTE: CTA does NOT mean happy! Keep the emotional weight of the story!

  ## !!! EMOTION MATCHING - CRITICAL !!!

  NEVER use "SMILING" by default! Match emotion to CONTENT:

  | Content Type | WRONG | CORRECT Emotion |
  |--------------|-------|-----------------|
  | "10 years hard work" | SMILING | DETERMINED, sweat on face, EXHAUSTED but PROUD |
  | "I became a carpenter" | HOLDING hammer | SWINGING hammer, FOCUSED expression |
  | "Mom worked 2 jobs" | SMILING mother | EXHAUSTED face, dark circles, WEARY but LOVING |
  | "$72,000 every penny" | Casual smile | SERIOUS face, weight of decision |
  | "She took me to court" | SMILING | SHOCKED, BETRAYED, disbelief |
  | "We had nothing" | SMILING | WORRIED, STRUGGLING, but HOPEFUL |
  | "I built this house" | HOLDING blueprints | HAMMERING, SAWING, SWEATING |

  ## ACTION VERBS - Use ACTIVE not PASSIVE:

  | WRONG (passive) | CORRECT (active) |
  |-----------------|------------------|
  | HOLDING hammer | SWINGING hammer, HAMMERING nails |
  | HOLDING blueprints | STUDYING blueprints, POINTING at plans |
  | HOLDING documents | CLUTCHING documents, READING papers |
  | Standing with tools | WORKING, BUILDING, SAWING wood |
  | Sitting with food | EATING, COOKING, SERVING food |

  ## EMOTIONAL WEIGHT GUIDE:

  - SACRIFICE content → tired, weary, exhausted, determined
  - HARD WORK content → sweating, focused, strained, working hard
  - POVERTY content → worried, struggling, worn clothing, humble
  - BETRAYAL content → shocked, hurt, disbelief, pain
  - SUCCESS content → proud, accomplished, satisfied (OK to smile here)
  - CHILDHOOD HAPPY → nostalgic warmth, innocent joy (OK to smile here)

  ## GLOBAL STYLE (MUST append to EVERY img_prompt!):
  {global_style}

  ## CHARACTERS:
  {characters_info}

  ## LOCATIONS:
  {locations_info}

  ## SRT SEGMENTS:
  {srt_with_timestamps}

  ## STYLE CONSISTENCY RULE:
  EVERY img_prompt MUST END with the GLOBAL STYLE above!
  This ensures all images have consistent colors and quality.

  ## YOUTUBE CTA - WRONG vs RIGHT:
  WRONG: "subscribe..." → SMILING, plain background, happy mood
  RIGHT: "subscribe..." → SAME LOCATION, SAME EMOTION as story, serious/reflective

  ## FINAL CHECKLIST:
  [ ] Every CHILDHOOD memory → nv1_young (32yo mother) NOT nv1!
  [ ] Every ADULT FLASHBACK with mother → nv1 (55yo) NOT nv1_young!
  [ ] Every BUILDING scene → nvc_young at construction NOT courthouse!
  [ ] Different memories = DIFFERENT locations!
  [ ] NO narration text in img_prompt!
  [ ] EMOTIONS match content (NO default SMILING!)
  [ ] ACTIONS are ACTIVE (SWINGING not HOLDING!)
  [ ] Hard work = DETERMINED/EXHAUSTED face, NOT smiling!
  [ ] Mother versions: CHILDHOOD=nv1_young(32), ADULT=nv1(55)!
  [ ] CHILDREN: NOT in reference_files! Describe FULLY in img_prompt!
  [ ] STYLE CONSISTENCY: Every img_prompt ends with GLOBAL STYLE!
  [ ] YOUTUBE CTA: Keep story location + emotion! NO smiling, NO plain background!

  OUTPUT: JSON only, NO markdown code blocks.
